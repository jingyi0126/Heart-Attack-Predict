# Heart-Attack-Predic

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and model a dataset using various data preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The primary steps involved in this project include data visualization using Matplotlib, feature analysis, data preprocessing using Pandas and Scikit-learn (sklearn), including one-hot encoding, handling missing values, and scaling, followed by training machine learning models using the sklearn library.

## Steps Taken
***
### Data Visualization with Matplotlib
Utilized Matplotlib to visualize the dataset and explore various features.
Conducted preliminary analysis to identify correlations and patterns within the data.
***
### Data Preprocessing with Pandas and Scikit-learn
Employed Pandas for data manipulation tasks such as filtering, grouping, and selecting relevant features.
Utilized Scikit-learn for preprocessing tasks including:
One-hot encoding categorical variables to convert them into numerical representation.
Handling missing values by imputation or deletion strategies.
Scaling numerical features to ensure uniformity and convergence during model training.
***
### Machine Learning Model Training with Scikit-learn
Utilized Scikit-learn's machine learning models to train on preprocessed data.
Experimented with various algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc.
Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tuned hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search or randomized search to optimize model performance.
